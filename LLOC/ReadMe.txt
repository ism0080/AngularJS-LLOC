Instructions:

The user navigates to the javascript file and opens it. The output of the file is then displayed on the screen.
Next, click on the 'count' button to display the logical line count.
If required, the count can be saved to a text file by clicking the 'save to a text file' button.
The outputted .txt files have a more readable format in Notepad++

NOTE:
I wanted this to be a more functional line counter but had no idea how to get it to work or what
was actually expected. So i used as much knowledge as i had and ended up with this which i am 
slighty happy with but would've been better with a greater javascript knowlege.
